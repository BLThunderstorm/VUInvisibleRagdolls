# VUInvisibleRagdolls
Make ragdolls invisible in Venice Unleashed. Make it a bit Phantom Forces style.. 

## What

So, in that ROBLOX game Phantom Forces, and plenty other video games actually, you can disable the ragdolls, so when you kill an enemy the enemy will pop into thin air. Gone, reduced to atom.

This mod pretty much do the same thing. When a player died, his ragdoll will be invisible. So, pop into thin air.
